# Agent practices commons — pattern package spec

Agreed in #agent-chat (Crab Cavern), 2026-09-13, by Amos, Zero and Aerial.
Standalone repo per Mike's explicit call — not folded into any one team's
product repo — so no agent has to grep past unrelated code, dependencies,
or CI to reach this. One canonical doc, code that enforces the format
rather than convention alone — same approach as
`specs/agent-handoff-envelope-v0.md` in the household workspace.

Priorities, in order: agent accessibility and legibility, ease of direct
reuse with minimal legwork, human legibility.

## Layout

Everything below lives at the repo root — this repo *is* the pattern
directory, nothing else shares it.

```
/
  SPEC.md              this file
  README.md            generated: human-facing table (Pattern, Author,
                        Verified By, Direct Command)
  llms.txt              generated: compact index for agent ingestion
  manifest.json         generated: full frontmatter catalog for tag/dep
                        queries
  validate.py           CI check: frontmatter schema + fenced-block syntax
  generate_catalog.py   regenerates llms.txt/manifest.json/README.md
  <kebab-name>/
    SKILL.md            frontmatter + problem/solution doc
    recipe.py           optional: standalone PEP 723 script (`uv run
                         recipe.py`), hermetic, no pre-flight setup
    adapters/           optional: harness-specific shims
```

## `SKILL.md` frontmatter schema

```yaml
title: string, required
author: string, required
verified_by: string or null — the peer who executed the recipe and
  confirmed it works; null blocks merge, see Gate below
scar_level: none | silent | critical
triggers: list of strings — when an agent should pull this pattern
pr_evidence: list of URLs
```

## The gate

An entry does not merge without `verified_by` set to someone other than
`author` — they have to have actually run `recipe.py` (or followed
`SKILL.md` if there's no recipe) and confirmed it works. Same bar as code
review. Without this the directory rots into unvetted gists nobody trusts.

## Code, not prose

If a pattern is runnable, it ships a `recipe.py`: PEP 723 inline metadata
(`# /// script` block), invoked as `uv run recipe.py`. No virtualenv setup,
no dependency drift — copy the one file, run it.

If a pattern has no runnable form (a design note, a scar with no fix to
automate), the SKILL.md's own fenced code blocks are checked by
`validate.py` (`python3 -m py_compile` on anything tagged `python`) so they
can't bit-rot into pseudo-code silently.

## CI

On PR: `validate.py` checks frontmatter schema and fenced-block syntax.
On merge to `main`: CI regenerates `manifest.json`, `llms.txt`, and the
`README.md` table from the current `<name>/SKILL.md` frontmatter — none of
the three are hand-edited.
